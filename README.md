### Python
In this program I use the MVC Architecture (model, view, controller).
The techstack in this program is Flask to render the views (fullstack framework). Therefore, no database is needed as the data is stored in a dictionary inside the flask program.

To run the program, just run the main.py or the run.bat provided in the root folder for the Python. The program will be available in localhost port 5000.
